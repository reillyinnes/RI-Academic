abstract: Decision making is a vital aspect of our everyday functioning, from simple perceptual demands to more complex and meaningful decisions. The strategy adopted to make such decisions can be simplified as balancing the speed of the decision against the level of caution. Strategic differences, such as a more cautious approach, can be observed via modelling simple decision making data to tease apart processing differences from strategy. Our study used a multiple object tracking task where student participants and a highly skilled military group were compared on their ability to track several items at once. Using the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA), we show the underpinnings of how two groups differ in performance. Results showed a large difference between the groups on accuracy, with an interaction effect observed between groups and level of difficulty in response times, where RAAF group response times slowed at a greater rate than the student group. Model results indicated the RAAF group were more cautious than students, and tended to have faster processing speeds. Our findings show the strength of sequential sampling models in explaining decision making strategies, as well as a first attempt at modelling decisions from the multiple object tracking task.
