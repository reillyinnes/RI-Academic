My name is Reilly Innes and I'm a Post Doc Researcher at the University of Amsterdam. I study decision making modelling in the [Integrative Model-based Cognitive Neuroscience Research Unit](https://www.subcortex.eu/). My work in the IMCN currently focuses on methods of joint modelling, using data from behavioural decision making tasks and fMRI to gather greater insight into the functional (and structural) relationships between brain and behaviour. 

Previously, I completed my thesis and worked as a post-doc at the [Newcastle Cognition Lab](https://newcastlecl.org/). My thesis focused on extending methods of cognitive workload measurement to new environments and for new purposes. I then spent a year as a post doc in the [Newcastle Cognition Lab](https://newcastlecl.org/), both as a part of the the [PMwG team](https://github.com/NewcastleCL) and on various cognitive modelling projects. Previously, I worked as a data analyst at Hunter New England Local Health District with the [FluTracking](https://info.flutracking.net/) team.

My work with the samplers team primarily involved making advanced statistical methods accessible to a broader community. This work has resulted in the Particle Metropolis within Gibbs (PMWG) [R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pmwg/index.html) and [bookdown](https://newcastlecl.github.io/samplerDoc/). Keep an eye out for a series of upcoming blog posts at Newcastle Cognition Lab samplers team [website](https://newcastlecl.github.io) and on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/ReillyInnes).
